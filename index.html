    <h1>The things I do</h1>
    <p>A wicked wind whips through cold, concrete corridors. It swirls around a co-sourced team stoking innovation. The kinetic energy of a team of fingers crackle as they type, keeping the blaze afire. We've left the comfort of our own private hearth and gone forth onto an unchartered tundra. We're building something out here. We're taking a risk but we're self-sustaining and we've brought the tools we need to go beyond surival. We're here to thrive.</p>
    <p>I'm in this team. I'm helping out. I'm filling in the gaps. I'm learning. I'm giving back. I also write flowery prose.</p>
    <p class="centre-break">‚ÅÇ</p>
    <p>I'm a polyfill, an allrounder. In 2010 I joined ThoughtWorks as a tester and I have the experience and a passion needed to test. In my past life I've worked as a developer; pushing code every day. Since 2010 I've added more strings to my bow. I can support analysts, I have an eye for experience design, I'm a steady hand. I bring this and more to the teams I work within.</p>

        </h1>
        <p>I ventured back into this insurance company to coach a pair of their graduates on building out a replacement test tool. The client had an application that collected SOAP XML documents from a queue and stored them in a database. A server side web application would allow filtering over the dataset. It suffered performance problems</p>
        <p>We replaced it with an AngularJS client (shifting the HTML contruction performance to each client), a service that serves JSON documents (with hypermedia controls). The queue reader became a standalone app. This allowed us to dedicate more instances to the queues that get more activity.</p>
        <p>The final part was profiling the components and the DB and making tweaks to get throughput up (on the queue reader) and the latency down (on the website). The thing has a hundred or so users and processes between 200,000 and 500,000 messages per day.</p>

        <p>I joined a team that was trying to introduce Continuous Delivery practices with the organisation. My first task was to develop a new automation testing tool that would provide Soap UI capability with a more natural interface. This would allow non-technical testers to express their technical webservice intergration tests using a structured semi-natural language.</p>
        <p>
        After this, we changed tack and started working with one of the organisation's vendors. I looked at how they worked and the code they were producing. I built examples using their code to show how to increase testability and reduce complexity through this one weird little trick.

My job was to provide advice on how to structure their code to get the best reuse across the two platforms.

        <p>This project was for an online payment and billing system. I joined the project as a tester but it came clear that having no analysts was hindering the team. I switched roles to fill the need.</p>
        <p>When joining the project the intent was to help out the original team on a death march. We realised that a successful outcome was not possible within the selected integration partner and the timeframes desired. I worked with the team and the organisation to bring about the cancellation of the project.</p>

        <p>I worked within a large co-sourced team to deliver a new paper-based report for advertisers. The system had four parts, a scalable Java-based event capture system. A data warehouse responsible for aggregating and organising events. A report generation process and later, an online reporting system.</p>
        <p>My work on this project was a mixture of coaching and doing. With analysts I helped to improve how we defined the scope of each story and our acceptance critera. With developers I helped to improve the quality of their testing.</p>
        <p>The more stereotypical work on this project was focusing on exploratory testing, user interaction testing and introducing the concept of mule testing: a technique I devised for challenging and validating assumptions in complex products in evolved domains.</p>

        <p>I was responsible for the foundation and training of the service testing team. I created the automation framework, trained and mentored testers and helping the organisation scale from four to fifty services.</p>
        <p>I was the Test Lead on ten projects; some of these were high profile both within and without the AFP including the NPRS (National Police Reference System) an inter-jurisdictional projects involving CrimTrac and each state's police-force. I worked on the Missing Persons project, which automated the reporting processes of the missing persons within the AFP and shared that information with NPRS. The Missing Persons project received excellent reviews from the users because it simplified their workflow and made it easier to meet their reporting obligations.</p>
        <p>I was also responsible for building tools to assist the testing team in both testing and to facilitate testing. Such tools included an integrating Loadrunner and Quick Test Pro into a Continuous Integration server, A DOORS to Quality Centre synchronisation tool and a test data generator for performance testing.</p>
