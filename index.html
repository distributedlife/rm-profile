    <h1>The things I do</h1>
    <p>
      I am a tech lead with ThoughtWorks. My sweet spot is leading small teams working on small systems. My view is that most systems could be smaller and should have less complexity. My approach is to strip away superfluous details and build only what is needed now to meet the proven business need.
    </p>
    <p>
      My recent experience has been in JavaScript including mobile and web projects, node services and lambdas. Prior lives have been lived near Ruby, Java and C++.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a polyfill. In 2010 I joined ThoughtWorks as a tester with a passion for software testing. Before that, I was a developer. During my years at ThoughtWorks, I've added more strings to my bow: some analysis work, some experience design work before going back to software development.

        <p>
          This tribunal had been charged with determining if online dispute resolution (ODR) would increase access to justice for Victorians.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked with them to determine the feasibility of an ODR solution. This involved building a customer journey, understanding the existing IT landscape and reviewing the current market participants. We devised a series of low-cost experiments that could be used to prove the need for different ODR features. The outcome of these experiments could drive the vendor selection process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked with the Program Directory to present their findings to internal stakeholders (CEO, President, Justices) as well as external stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of the project resulted in the tribunal being invited to an external committee to shape an International Symposium on Online Dispute Resolution.

          A Field Operations Company

        </h1>
        <p>
          When I joined the project as tech lead they were on a journey towards a clustered micro-services architecture deployed to Azure. When I left ten-months later, they had a low-operations serverless architecture deployed on AWS and an application deployed to both Android and iOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed for the architecture change when I saw the client had a limited operations capacity. I worked with the client to devise a solution that would have a low-operations overhead and be as self-healing as possible while would scaling to meet their growing user-base.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had a working prototype ready for the first showcase and we deployed to users within four months and deployed weekly through the rest of the year. The project was a huge success for the client with their staff raving about how great the new application was compared to their existing product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did I mention the project was on time, on budget and on-spec? Yep. That happened. Again.

          GraphCI
          <p class="duration">The docker-first and docker-last graph based CI system with package support.</p>
        </h1>
        <p>
          Fed up with the plethora of second-rate CI systems currently in the market, a friend and I
          built our own CI system. Our core difference was to formalise docker into the system as docker
          is added onto almost every build system I have seen in the past five years. This also allows
          the user to run the exact same build locally and remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second aspect is an immutable system to ensure that one build step cannot modify the
          results of completed steps. This is common in build systems and makes diagnosing build
          failures more difficult than they need to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third aspect was the concept of a build package system. This would allow users to define
          common deployment systems that can be shared with other users. I need to deploy some node
          lambdas to AWS. There is a package for that. I need to build a Jar. There is a package for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've worked on a dozen different build systems and I find myself and everyone else repeating
          the same thing again and again. With packages, we could start leveraging that work the same
          way that we do with packages in modern programming languages.

        <p>I worked with a fantastic team of ThoughtWorkers and Target employees to build the world's best retail app. We took a research-driven approach that found us in stores, talking to almost 1,500 Target customers over the course of seven months.</p>
        <p>Through tireless design iteration and a team that has a knack for attention to detail, we built something that Target shoppers want and use. As of February 2016, we had 290K installs, a great active user rate and a conversion rate higher than other Target channels.</p>
        <p>This has been the best project I've ever worked on. Did I mention the project was on time, under budget and over delivered? Yep. That happened.</p>

        <p>I ventured back into this insurance company to coach a pair of their graduates on building out a replacement test tool. The client had an application that collected SOAP XML documents from a queue and stored them in a database. A server-side web application would allow filtering over the dataset. It suffered performance problems</p>
        <p>We replaced it with an AngularJS client (shifting the HTML construction performance to each client), a service that serves JSON documents (with hypermedia controls). The queue reader became a standalone app. This allowed us to dedicate more instances to the queues that get more activity.</p>
        <p>The final part was profiling the components and the DB and making tweaks to improve throughput (on the queue reader) and reduce latency (on the website). The application supports a hundred users and processes between 200,000 and 500,000 messages per day.</p>

        <p>For this client, I completed an assessment of their development process. My focus was on testing, feedback and quality. I looked at how long it took for them to take an idea from inception to delivery and at what stages the work would require rework.</p>

        <p>I worked with a small mobile development team that was producing three mobile applications that each supported both Android and iOS; six apps in total. My job was to provide advice on how to structure their code to get the best reuse across the two platforms. I also set up a build system that would, for each check-in compile and test the code for each platform. We automatically packaged successful commits and made them ready for deployment and manual exploratory testing.</p>

        <p>This project was for an online payment and billing system. I joined the project as a tester but it came clear that having no analysts was hindering the team. I switched roles to fill the need.</p>
        <p>When joining the project the intent was to help out the original team on a death march. We realised that a successful outcome was not possible within the selected integration partner and the timeframes desired. I worked with the team and the organisation to bring about the cancellation of the project.</p>

        <p>I worked within a large co-sourced team to deliver a new paper-based report for advertisers. The system had four parts, a scalable Java-based event capture system. A data warehouse responsible for aggregating and organising events. A report generation process and later, an online reporting system.</p>
        <p>My work on this project was a mixture of coaching and doing. With analysts, I helped to improve how we defined the scope of each story and our acceptance criteria. With developers, I helped to improve the quality of their testing.</p>
        <p>The more stereotypical work on this project was focusing on exploratory testing, user interaction testing and introducing the concept of mule testing: a technique I devised for challenging and validating assumptions in complex products in evolved domains.</p>

I worked on the Missing Persons project, which automated the reporting processes of the missing persons within the AFP and shared that information with NPRS. The Missing Persons project received excellent reviews from the users because it simplified their workflow and made it easier to meet their reporting obligations.</p>
        <p>I was also responsible for building tools to assist the team in both testing and to facilitate testing. Such tools included an integrating Loadrunner and Quick Test Pro into a Continuous Integration server, A DOORS to Quality Centre synchronisation tool and a test data generator for performance testing.</p>
